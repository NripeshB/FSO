# FullStackOpen Exercise Submissions

This repository contains my exercise solutions for the [FullStackOpen](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course.

## Repository Structure
- Solutions are organized into directories by part (`part0`, `part1`, `part2`, â€¦).
- Each **part** contains a small project consisting of multiple discrete exercises.
- Individual solutions can be tracked through the commit history of each partâ€™s directory.

## Commit Convention
Commits are written in the following format: "fso part2 exercise 2.1-2.5 solved"


## Blog Documentation
I have also documented the issues I faced, along with insights gained during this journey, on my blog:
